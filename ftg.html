    <h1>Their Mission</h1>
    <p><center>They stand behind the idea of "enclothed cognition". Don't worry, they didn't know what it meant at first either. The idea is that clothing has a systematic influence on the wearer's psychological processes.

        Basically, when you wear clothes they make you feel and think a certain way. They believe that our clothes are directly aligned with their brands mission and values. This means that when you wear any of your "FTG" gear your reinforcing positive habits and coping mechanisms to help yourself find the good when you're feeling down.</center></p>
