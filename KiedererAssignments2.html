        Heyyy! Welcome! I’m Max and I’m coordinating a group to Dublin, Ireland. This is my third trip with EF Ultimate Break and I hope to have many more trips planned! I’m looking forward to checking off Dublin as a destination and touring the Guinness Store house. I can’t wait to have a Guinness and hopefully with you! My favorite destination so far has been either Mykonos, Rome, or Barcelona. There’s too many to choose from and they’re all great in their different ways. Love trying the local cuisines and taking in the atmosphere and culture of the places. I’m <em>#teamwindow</em> when it comes to flying (best spot to take naps or sleep) and counting down the days to departure! Come experience the Dublin City Experience with me from <strong>July 5th to July 11th 2025</strong>. See you there!</p>
